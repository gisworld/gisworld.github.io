<p><strong> Skills </strong></p>
<p> I have experience with Python, Javascript, PHP and C# in varying degrees. </p>
<p> As a GIS analyst/developer the majority of my experience is with geographic libraries such as: <p>
<ul> 
<li> ArcGIS APIs for Flex, Silverlight and Javascript </li>
<li> ArcObjects </li>
<li> ArcPy and PyQGIS </li>
<li> OpenLayers (Still learning)</li>
</ul>
<p> I have previously utilised SQLServer and currently utilise PostgreSQL (with PostGIS) as my go to database. </p>
<p> My strength is in the Esri software stack however I am constantly learning Open Source software packages such as QGIS and Geoserver </p> 
<p><strong> Work History </strong></p>
<p> I started out as an intern at Esri South Africa in the Professional Services department progressing to Junior Developer position. My responsibilities included: data manipulation, 
data cleansing, map creation, web mapping using the Flex API, providing training for Esri courses, presenting at conferences and creating bespoke tools using ArcObjects.
I mainly completed projects for the mining sector, electricity generation and municipalities. </p>
