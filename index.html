<p> These examples of Agent based modelling were created as part of the practical component of the <a href ="http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=201718&M=GEOG-5991M"> Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills (WUN) </a> course
taught by Leeds University as part of the MSc GIS (ODL). </p>
<strong>Standard ABM </strong>
<p> The code creates a set number of sheep (agents) randomly placed onto a "field". The sheep move 1 step at a time in a random direction.
After each step, the sheep will eat 10 units of grass before moving on. After eating 100 units, the sheep will be sick.
This set of code animates the movements until all the sheep are at least half full (i.e. their stomachs (stores) contains at least 50 units of grass).
Finally the model writes out the new environment and the sheep stores to text files. </p>
<strong>Enhanced ABM </strong>
<p> The enhanced model introduces Wolves to the model. Two wolves, represented as grey diamonds<span style="color:#2c2d2d"> &diams;  </span> are randomly placed in the field. 
A wolf can eat a sheep that is within 10 steps of itself. The wolf will then start searching for another sheep from the recently deceased sheep's position. 
Dead sheep are represented by red crosses <strong><span style="color: red"> X </span></strong>on the map. 
The model stops running when all the sheep have been eaten or 200 iterations. 
Finally the model writes out the new environment and the remaining sheep stores to text files.
