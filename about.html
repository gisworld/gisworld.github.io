I have a passion for everything spatial, believing spatially driven solutions usually provide the best results. I enjoy applying the wide range of manipulation and analysis tasks 
available through GIS to solve complex problems. I am currently a GIS Analyst/Developer at SeaRoc Group Ltd where I am able to solve complex problems and develop web applications.</p>
<p>
My role varies day to day encompassing GIS data management, server management, database management, seabed change analysis and web mapping. 
I am also a project manager for a select number of projects. 
</p>
<p><strong> Education </strong></p>
<p> Currenlty studying for an MSc GIS (ODL) through Leeds University to further strengthen my academic background focussing on the Development and Remore Sensing streams. </p>
<p> I hold a BSc Geoinformatics Honours degree from the University of Pretoria which provides a strong academic background in GIS, SQL, programming and remote sensing.
<br> In order to maintain my technical competency, I also complete various online courses such as Penn State's Geodesign MOOC. </p>
